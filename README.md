## 2. Describe your project?
I am currently working for an Australia-based client in the manufacturing industry, which operates multiple projects across Web, Mobile, and Desktop platforms. All these projects are interconnected through a centralized API.  

### **Project Overview**  
The ecosystem consists of:  
- **Three Web Applications:**  
  - **E-commerce Platform** – for online product sales (not directly involved).  
  - **Backoffice Management Portal** – for company and employee management.  
  - **Visitor Management System** – to handle visitor logs and permissions.  
- **Mobile Application (Ionic + Angular):** Primarily designed for backoffice management tasks.  
- **Desktop Application:** Facilitates document synchronization between the local system and the server.  

### **Tech Stack & Development Approach**  
- **Frontend:** Angular for web applications and Ionic with Angular for mobile.  
- **Backend:** .NET Core for APIs and SQL Server for database management.  
- **Component Reusability:** Implemented an Angular Library project containing shared components, services, models, and module-wise services, which is integrated into both web and mobile applications for better maintainability.  
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Integrated Material, PrimeNG, ZXing, Font Awesome, SignalR, and Form.io for enhanced functionality.  

### **Key Modules & Functionalities**  
#### **Backoffice Management Portal**  
- A role-based system displaying menus based on user permissions.  
- Includes various modules such as:  
  - Dashboard, Helpdesk, Customer & Visitor Management, Order Management, Estimation Review/Response, Learning, Quality Control, Audits, Reports, Employee Management, and Job Orders.  
- **Document Manager:** A persistent sidebar displaying context-specific documents that update dynamically based on page navigation.  
- **Security Enhancements:**  
  - Implemented interceptors to encrypt requests and decrypt responses.  
  - Applied API rate limiting to mitigate brute force attacks.  
- **Low-Code Forms:** Developed a module using Form.io for dynamic form generation.  

#### **Mobile Application (Ionic + Angular)**  
- Features include Logbook, Audits/Assessments, Workshop Approvals & Status, Jobcard Signoff, Asset Compliance, and PO Requisition Approvals.  
- **Geo-Locked Access:** Certain forms can only be accessed within predefined geographical boundaries.  
- **Kiosk Mode:**  
  - The application is installed on 150+ tablets integrated with machinery in the client’s workshop.  
  - Devices auto-login using machine-specific credentials, allowing users to perform predefined tasks such as logbook updates, audits, and asset compliance.  

#### **Desktop Application (Document Synchronization)**  
- Designed to sync documents between a user's local folder and the server, similar to Amazon Photos.  
- Features include:  
  - **Pause/Resume Sync:** Users can control synchronization as needed.  
  - **Sync Limitations:** Implemented controls on the number of files synced concurrently.  
  - **Integration with Backoffice Management:** Synced documents are directly accessible in the Document Manager.  

### **My Roles and Responsibilities**  
- Collaborated with the client for requirement gathering and estimation.  
- Developed and maintained the Backoffice Management Portal and Visitor Management System.
- Devloped Mobile Application and Desktop Application from scratch.    
- Strengthened security by implementing encrypted API communication and rate limiting.  
- Designed and implemented document synchronization in the Desktop Application.  
- Built and integrated reusable components using an Angular library for improved maintainability.  
- Developed dynamic, low-code forms for rapid form generation using Form.io.   

This project is a large-scale system managed by a dedicated team, including designers, project architect, DBAs, and QA specialists.
